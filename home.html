    <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>
    <p>One of my favorite places to eat around Brown's campus is 
      <a href="https://www.chongqinghouseri.com/"><b style="font-size:20px;color:darkred;">Chong Qing House</b></a>. I've used their 
      website amid the Covid outbreak and thought it would be meaningful to evaluate and redesign 
      their online platform as their old customer. 
    </p>
    <h2>
      Identifying Usability Problems
    </h2>
    <p>Upon revisiting their website, I was able to pinpoint some usability issues that I've learned from class.</p>
    <img src="website.png"/>
    <ol>
      <li>Header of website is too <b>lengthy</b></li>
      <li>The Categories tab is <b>repetitive</b>, “Menu” tab exists</li>
      <li>Having today’s date doesn’t seem necessary</li>
      <li>Restaurant description is <b>misleading</b> and is not up to date</li>
      <li>Search menu can be in the <b>navigation bar</b></li>
      <li><b>Order</b> of the tabs on the navigation bar isn’t coherent</li>
      <li><b>Duplicate</b> navigation bar in the footer</li>
      <li>Could mention these are notices regarding Covid response</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
      Evaluating for Accessibility
    </h2>
    <img src="accessibility.png"/>
    <p>As shown in the WebAIM WAVE analysis, the website <b style="color:red">accounts for most accessibility issues</b> and uses proper navigation and 
      elements to structure the page. This allows the screen reader to read the contents 
      of the webpage <b style="color:red">from top to bottom in coherent order</b>. There are a 
      <b style="color:red">couple of alerts</b> as shown in the evaluation tool such as redundant links, 
      redundant title texts, and small text sizes.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Low-fidelity Wireframe
    </h2>
    <p>
      Combining all the problems I've identified above, I put together a low-fidelity wireframe of its main home page in three different layouts using Balsamiq.
    </p>
    <p><b>I. Mobile</b></p>
    <img src="low1.png"/>
    <p><b>II. Tablet</b></p>
    <img src="low2.png"/> 
    <p><b>III. Desktop</b></p>
    <img src="low3.png"/>
    <h2>
      High-fidelity Prototype
    </h2>
    <p>
      Afterwards, utilizing the wireframes as a guide, I put together a high-fidelity prototype via Figma.
    </p>
    <p><b>I. Mobile</b></p>
    <img src="phone.png"/>
    <p><b>II. Tablet</b></p>
    <img src="ipad.png"/>
    <p><b>III. Desktop</b></p>
    <img src="web1.png"/>
    <img src="web2.png"/>
    <h2>
      Visual Design Style Guide
    </h2>
    <p>
      Here's a visual representation of all the interactive components in the website:

    <h2>
      Responsive Redesign
    </h2>
    <p>
      The redesigned version of the website is responsive in the following ways:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Screen is responsive with the size of browser</li>
      <li>Text alters between "open" and "close" based on business hours in real time</li>
      <li>Navigation bar shrinks when the window is minimized, replaces with hamburger menu</li>
      <li>Dropdown menu when user toggles the hamburger icon</li>
      <li>Hovering over clickable text, icons, and buttons change color</li>
    </ol>
    <a href="redesign.html" ><b style="text-align:center; font-size:20px;color:red;">Check out the redesigned version of the website here!</b></a>
    <p>
      After testing the website on various accessibility and responsive tools, I learned that it is important to 
      be careful and deliberate with html tags and their labels. Nowadays, people access websites using various devices,
      thus it was very meaningful to experiment different sizes and layout to ensure that the website is accessibly across all dimensions.
